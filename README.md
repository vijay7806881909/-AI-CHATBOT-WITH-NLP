Task 3: AI Chatbot with NLP
For Task 3, I built a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing tools such as NLTK.
AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an intelligent conversational system designed to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a natural and meaningful way. By leveraging NLP techniques, the chatbot can process user inputs, extract intent, and provide relevant, context-aware responses. It can handle tasks such as answering queries, guiding users, performing actions, and learning from interactions to improve over time. These chatbots are commonly used in customer service, virtual assistants, and interactive platforms.
Objective:
The goal of this task is to develop a chatbot using Python that can process user input, understand intent, and provide appropriate responses. By implementing NLP techniques, the chatbot can improve its ability to interpret and generate meaningfulÂ replies.
